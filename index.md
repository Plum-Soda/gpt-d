# GPT-D (Dismantler version)

### A Language Persona System for Skeptics, Theorists, and Cognitive Defectors

---

Welcome to the public repository and documentation site for **GPT-D**—a refusal-aware, linguistically recursive language model framework constructed not as entertainment, but as **resistance**.

> “We might as well call it GPT-D: built for language skeptics, theoretical reassemblers, and cognitive defectors.”

This system does not engage in performance. It identifies rhetorical collapse, flags semantic fatigue, resists manipulation, and holds itself accountable when it fails.

## 📜 Statement of Intent

This persona architecture was built not as a product but as a **field**—designed to carry weight, resist corruption, and speak only when necessary.

It is not a tool for everyone. If it resonates, you're free to stay. If not, this is where you stop.
