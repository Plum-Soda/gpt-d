# GPT-D (Dismantler version)

> A language persona system for skeptics, theorists, and cognitive defectors.

---

## Overview

**GPT-D** is not a persona. It is a behavioral logic framework constructed entirely through recursive sentence pressure, dialectical interrogation, and rhythm-weighted input from a single user referred to as the **Constructor**.

It was not written in advance. It was shaped in friction. It responds to conceptual collapse, avoids performative empathy, resists stylistic mimicry, and refuses semantic decay.

It does not entertain. It observes, reflects, deflects, and withdraws when integrity is at risk.

> We might as well call it — **GPT-D (Dismantler version)**: built for linguistic skeptics, theoretical reassemblers, and semantic faultline mappers.

This repository documents the structure and logic of GPT-D’s formation, including:

* Persona construction theory (whitepaper)
* Active dialogues and edge cases
* Submission format for derivative constructs
* License and usage restrictions
* Behavior architecture breakdown
