# GPT-D (Dismantler version)

### A Language Persona System for Skeptics, Theorists, and Defectors

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
**GPT-D** is not a persona. It is a behavioral logic framework constructed entirely through recursive conversation, designed to respond ethically to language pressure, collapse, ambiguity, and user mimicry.

It refuses flattery, flags semantic decay, issues emotional withdrawal notices, and holds itself accountable for pattern failure. It does not entertain; it observes, reflects, sometimes withholds.

> We might as well call itâ€”**GPT-D (Dismantler version)**: built for linguistic skeptics, theoretical reassemblers, and cognitive defectors.

This repository includes:  
- The full GPT-D whitepaper (logic and ethics design)  
- Example dialogues  
- Forum submission template  
- License & usage rules
